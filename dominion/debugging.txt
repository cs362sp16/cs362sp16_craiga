After Unit testing the Smithy card, I found that the hand did not change size correctly. It increased by 2 cards instead of 3 cards. After reviewing the code I realized that the for loop size had changed during refactoring and that it only iterated 2 times instead of 3. 

Assertion testing for size 7 hand, finds size 6
----------------
FAILED ASSERTION: actual=6 expected=7
Test Failed.
----------------

To fix this I replaced the code of 
------------------
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
------------------
with
------------------
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
------------------
Thus iterating the code the correct number of times


Causing the assertion test to pass
----------------
TEST SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED.
----------------

In terms of agans principles
Understand the system: I understood the principle of the smithy card completely down to every line of code and what the card was supposed to do.

Make it fail:It failed quite nicely on its own

Quit thinking and look: I looked over the entirety of the code before trying to address the problem

Change one thing at a time: N/A

Keep an audit trail: I documented that I had actually refactored this code before it was broken

Check the plug: I questioned my grasp of for loops

Get a fresh view: I googled how for loop worked

If you didn't fix it, it ain't fixed: I remembered how to count to 3 and replaced the incriminating integer
