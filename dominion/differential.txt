Well because their dominion had a repaired version of scoreFor that correctly counted the number of total cards towards Garden's score their dominion would output a higher score for a player whenever they purchased a garden. The bug was apparent becasue I knew how the codes differed but would have been nearly infeasable to differentiate without that data.

This is not an ideal case for differential testing because both codes share the same base code and its many flaws.

The coverage was shy of 60% on first try but reached it after several attempts. code coverage was similar on both versions of dominion.
