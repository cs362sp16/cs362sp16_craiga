How to reproduce bug:

When scoring for a game that includes a garden the garden does not correctly count towards the score.
This is due to the line...

if (state->hand[player][i] == gardens) { score = score + ( fullDeckCount(player, 0, state) / 10 ); }

in the scoreFor Function, because it only tallies the number of total curses and devides it by ten.
For full functionality, it should be replaced with the line

if (state->hand[player][i] == gardens) { score = score + ( (state->deckCount[state->whoseTurn]+state->discardCount[state->whoseTurn]+state->handCount[state->whoseTurn])/ 10 ); };
    
This will account for all of the cards

Severity:High
Fixability:Easy
